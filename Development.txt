1. Project Title: Development of a Dynamic Ride-Sharing and Carpooling Platform
2. Project Statement and Outcomes:
The "Smart Ride Sharing System" project aims to develop a website-based platform where vehicle owners traveling long distances can share their available seats with passengers heading in the same direction. This system will allow drivers to post their trips and passengers to book seats based on their destinations. The fare calculation will be dynamic, depending on the distance each passenger travels.
The outcome will be a user-friendly web application that facilitates seamless ride-sharing. It will include features like route-based matching, fare estimation, secure payment integration, and user reviews. The project will ensure transparency, cost-effectiveness, and sustainability by reducing the number of vehicles on the road while promoting shared mobility.

3. Modules to be Implemented:
? User Management Module
? Ride Posting and Booking Module
? Fare Calculation & Payment Module
? Route Matching & Tracking Module
? Notification and Review System
? Admin Dashboard for Monitoring






4. Milestone-wise Module Implementation and High-Level Requirements:
Milestone 1: User Management & Ride Posting Module
Objectives
* Create secure user accounts for drivers and passengers.
* Enable drivers to post rides and passengers to search/book them.
?? Features to Implement
1. User Management
o Registration & Login (via email/phone).
o Password encryption with BCrypt/Argon2.
o Role-based access: Driver / Passenger.
o User profiles:
* Passenger ? name, contact, history.
* Driver ? name, contact, vehicle details (car model, license plate, capacity).
2. Authentication & Security
o Use Spring Security + JWT for authentication.
o Session/token-based login/logout.
3. Ride Posting (Driver)
o Post a ride with details:
* Source, Destination, Date, Time.
* Available seats.
* Vehicle details auto-filled from profile.
o Store rides in rides table.
4. Ride Search & Booking (Passenger)
o Search rides by source, destination, date.
o Filter options (price range, vehicle type, driver rating).
o Seat booking with passenger details.
5. Booking Confirmation
o Once booked, seat availability reduces.
o Confirmation visible in both driver & passenger dashboards.
?? Deliverables
* Working user registration, login, and role-based access.
* Ride posting by drivers and seat booking by passengers.
* Booking confirmation system with seat updates.

Milestone 2: Fare Calculation, Payment & Route Matching
Objectives
* Implement distance-based dynamic fare calculation.
* Secure online payments.
* Ensure passengers match with drivers efficiently.
?? Features to Implement
1. Dynamic Fare Calculation
o Use APIs like Google Maps Distance Matrix to calculate travel distance.
o Fare = Base Fare + (Rate per Km × Distance).
o Split cost if multiple passengers (e.g., proportional to distance covered).
2. Payment Integration
o Integrate Razorpay/Stripe/PayPal.
o Passengers pay online when booking.
o Drivers receive payment after ride completion (wallet/transfer).
o Store transaction history in payments table.
3. Transaction History
o Both drivers and passengers can see past payments, ride history, and receipts.
4. Real-Time Updates
o Drivers notified of bookings instantly.
o Passengers updated if driver cancels/reschedules.
o Use WebSockets or Firebase Realtime Database for live updates.
5. Route Matching
o Smart algorithm to suggest closest matches:
* Direct matches ? Same source/destination.
* Partial matches ? Passenger joins along driver's route.
?? Deliverables
* Automated fare calculation per distance.
* Integrated secure payment gateway.
* Ride/booking updates in real-time.
* Route-matching system working.

Milestone 3: Notification System, Review & Admin Dashboard
Objectives
* Improve user engagement with notifications.
* Build trust with rating/review features.
* Provide admins with oversight.
?? Features to Implement
1. Notifications
o In-app notifications for:
* Booking confirmation.
* Ride reminders (X hours before).
* Ride updates (cancellation/reschedule).
o Email/SMS notifications (via Spring Mail/Twilio).
2. Review System
o After ride completion:
* Passenger rates driver (stars + comments).
* Driver rates passenger.
o Store in reviews table ? show average rating in profiles.
3. Admin Dashboard
o Monitor all rides, bookings, and payments.
o Manage users (block fraudulent users, verify drivers).
o Generate reports:
* Total rides, earnings, active users.
* Ride cancellations & disputes.
?? Deliverables
* Notification system (in-app + email).
* Review & rating functionality.
* Admin dashboard for monitoring system health.

Milestone 4: Testing, Review & Documentation
 Objectives
* Ensure quality, stability, and security.
* Deliver proper documentation & deployment guide.
?? Features to Implement
1. Testing
o Unit Testing: JUnit + Mockito.
o Integration Testing: Spring Boot Test.
o API Testing: Postman.
o Load Testing: JMeter (simulate multiple concurrent bookings).
2. Review
o Security checks (SQL injection, XSS prevention).
o Scalability review (DB indexing, caching frequently searched rides).
3. Documentation
o Developer docs: ER diagram, architecture diagram, API endpoints (Swagger).
o User guide: Step-by-step flow for passengers & drivers.
o Deployment guide: Local + Cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure).
4. Final Adjustments
o Bug fixes.
o UI polishing.
o Feedback incorporation.
?? Deliverables
* Fully tested ride-sharing platform.
* Documentation (developer + user).
* Deployment-ready system.
